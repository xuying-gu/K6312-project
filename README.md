Machine learning project of K6312-Predicting Sentiment from Clothing Review
Abstract
The development of the internet has promoted the prosperity of e-commerce, and the consumer re- views have become very important information for producers to learn the public sentiment on their products. In this project, we did basic data analysis and visualization based on “Women’s Clothing E-Commerce” dataset from Kaggle to see consumers’ general sentiments for the prod- uct, and constructed machine learning models and deep learning models to predict consumer senti- ment and make comparison of these models. We found that linear SVC can be used as preferred model for short text sentiment classification, and LR, deep learning model CNN+LSTM also have good performance in sentiment prediction. These machine learning and deep learning methods can make the prediction of consumers’ emotions more accurate, which can help improve the competitive- ness of e-commerce producers.
